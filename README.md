# EndpointPGPValidation
This is a small PHP Project that aims to increase the protection of API Endpoints and other services receiving requests.

This uses different methods, most notably PGP to send secure requests from one server to an endpoint with complete end-to-end encryption.
This does NOT require any special networking or advanced dependancies.
