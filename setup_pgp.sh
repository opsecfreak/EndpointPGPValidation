his script does the following:

    Installs GnuPG and the PHP GnuPG extension for the server.
    Installs Python pip and Python's GnuPG library.
    Creates a directory to store the generated keys.
    Generates a PGP key with some default and example options.
    Exports the public and private keys into .asc files within the ~/pgp_keys/ directory.

To run the script:

    Save the code into a file, for example, setup_pgp.sh.
    Make the script executable: chmod +x setup_pgp.sh.
    Run the script: ./setup_pgp.sh.

After running the script, you will find your public and private keys in the ~/pgp_keys/ directory.

Important Note: Always make sure to secure your private key. Anyone with access to it can decrypt your data.

This should provide you with a convenient way to set up the necessary environment for secure PGP-based communication.
